## Aurelia Plugin Structure

This Aurelia plugin project has a built-in dev app to simplify development.

1. The local `src/` folder, is the source code for the plugin.
2. The local `dev-app/` folder, is the code for the dev app, just like a normal app bootstrapped by aurelia-cli.
3. You can use normal `npm start` and `npm test` in development just like developing an app.
4. You can use aurelia-testing to test your plugin, just like developing an app.
5. To ensure compatibility to other apps, always use `PLATFORM.moduleName()` wrapper in files inside `src/`. You don't need to use the wrapper in `dev-app/` folder as dumber bundler supports module name without the wrapper.

### Resource import within the dev app

In dev app, when you need to manually import something from the inner plugin (for example, importing a class for dependency injection), just use `import {...} from "../src/path/to/resource";`.

Note this is different from the plugin project generated by aurelia-cli, where users need to use special name `"resources"` to reference the inner plugin. That unintuitive special name was designed to bypass limitation of RequireJS and SystemJS. Dumber bundler's AMD module loader (dumber-module-loader) has no such limitation.

## Manage dependencies

By default, this plugin has no "dependencies" in package.json. Theoretically this plugin depends on at least `aurelia-pal` because `src/index./* @if babel **js/* @endif *//* @if typescript **ts/* @endif */` imports it. It could also depends on more core Aurelia package like `aurelia-binding` or `aurelia-templating` if you build advanced components that references them.

Ideally you need to carefully add those `aurelia-pal` (`aurelia-binding`...) to "dependencies" in package.json. But in practice you don't have to. Because every app that consumes this plugin will have full Aurelia core packages installed.

Furthermore, there are two benefits by leaving those dependencies out of plugin's package.json.
1. ensure this plugin doesn't bring in a duplicated Aurelia core package to consumers' app. This is mainly for app built with webpack. We had been hit with `aurelia-binding` v1 and v2 conflicts due to 3rd party plugin asks for `aurelia-binding` v1.
2. reduce the burden for npm/yarn when installing this plugin.

If you are a perfectionist who could not stand leaving out dependencies, we recommend you to add `aurelia-pal` (`aurelia-binding`...) to "peerDependencies" in package.json. So at least it could not cause a duplicated Aurelia core package.

If your plugin depends on other npm package, like `lodash` or `jquery`, **you have to add them to "dependencies" in package.json**.

## Build Plugin

Run `npm run build`. This will transpile all files from `src/` folder to `dist/`.

For example, `src/index./* @if babel */js/* @endif *//* @if typescript */ts/* @endif */` will become `dist/index.js`.

Note all other files in `dev-app/` folder are for the dev app, they would not appear in the published npm package.

## Consume Plugin Privately

By default, the `dist/` folder is not committed to git. (We have `/dist` in `.gitignore`). But that would not prevent you from consuming this plugin through direct git reference.

You can consume this plugin directly by:
```shell
npm i github:your_github_username//* @echo name */
# or if you use bitbucket
npm i bitbucket:your_github_username//* @echo name */
# or if you use gitlab
npm i gitlab:your_github_username//* @echo name */
# or plain url
npm i https:/github.com/your_github_username//* @echo name */.git
```

Then load the plugin in app's `main./* @if babel **js/* @endif *//* @if typescript **ts/* @endif */` like this.
```js
aurelia.use.plugin('/* @echo name */');
// for webpack user, use PLATFORM.moduleName wrapper
aurelia.use.plugin(PLATFORM.moduleName('/* @echo name */'));
```

The missing `dist/` files will be filled up by npm through `"prepare": "npm run build"` (in `"scripts"` section of package.json).

Yarn has a [bug](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5235) that ignores `"prepare"` script. If you want to use yarn to consume your plugin through direct git reference, remove `/dist` from `.gitignore` and commit all the files. Note you don't need to commit `dist/` files if you only use yarn to consume this plugin through published npm package (`npm i /* @echo name */`).

## Publish npm package

By default, `"private"` field in package.json has been turned on, this prevents you from accidentally publish a private plugin to npm.

To publish the plugin to npm for public consumption:

1. Remove `"private": true,` from package.json.
2. Pump up project version. This will run through `npm test` (in "preversion" in package.json) first.
```shell
npm version patch # or minor or major
```
3. Push up changes to your git server
```shell
git push && git push --tags
```
4. Then publish to npm, you need to have your npm account logged in.
```shell
npm publish
```

## Automate changelog, git push, and npm publish

You can enable `npm version patch # or minor or major` to automatically update changelog, push commits and version tag to the git server, and publish to npm.

Here is one simple setup.
1. `npm i -D standard-changelog`. We use [`standard-changelog`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) as a minimum example to support conventional changelog.
  * Alternatively you can use high level [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version).
2. Add two commands to `"scripts"` section of package.json.
```
"scripts": {
  // ...
  "version": "standard-changelog && git add CHANGELOG.md",
  "postversion": "git push && git push --tags && npm publish"
},
```
3. you can remove `&& npm publish` if your project is private
