## Aurelia Plugin Structure

This Aurelia plugin project has a built-in dev app to simplify development.

1. The local `src/` folder, is the source code for the plugin.
2. The local `dev-app/` folder, is the code for the dev app, just like a normal app bootstrapped by aurelia-cli.
3. You can use normal `npm start` and `npm test` in development just like developing an app.
4. You can use aurelia-testing to test your plugin, just like developing an app.
5. To ensure compatibility to other apps, always use `PLATFORM.moduleName()` wrapper in files inside `src/`. You don't need to use the wrapper in `dev-app/` folder as dumber bundler supports module name without the wrapper.

### Resource import within the dev app

In dev app, when you need to manually import something from the inner plugin (for example, importing a class for dependency injection), just use `import {...} from "../src/path/to/resource";`.

Note this is different from the plugin project generated by aurelia-cli, where users need to use special name `"resources"` to reference the inner plugin. That unintuitive special name was designed to bypass limitation of RequireJS and SystemJS. Dumber bundler's AMD module loader (dumber-module-loader) has no such limitation.
