## Cypress e2e test
All e2e tests are in `cypress/integration/`.
// @if typescript
Note the source code of the app and unit tests is in TypeScript, but e2e tests are in plain ESNext JavaScript. You can however [write e2e tests in TypeScript too for Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/typescript-support.html#Transpiling-TypeScript-test-files).
// @endif

First, run the app in dev mode
```
npm run start
```

Then run e2e tests with

```
npm run test:e2e
```

Note if your dev app is not running on port 3000, you need to modify `cypress.json` to update dev app port.

To run Cypress interactively, do

```
npx cypress open
```
